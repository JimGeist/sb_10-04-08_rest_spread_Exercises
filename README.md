# sb_10-04-08_rest_spread_Exercises
Completed exercises utilizing rest and spread operators.

Exercise required refactoring filterOUtOdds() into a function that used rest and arrow functions. The exercise also
invoved wriring 9 functions that used rest and spread with arrays and objects. 

An unrequested function mergeCombineObjects(obj1, obj2) was created to better handle a merge by also combining like
keys. 

A helper function arraysAreTheSame(inArr1, inArr2) was created to aid in comparing arrays together to get meaningful 
test results in Jasmine.
